and find the way out  ouf  each of the 15 mazes !<br>

the maze has some  beautiful inhabitants !<br>

  bomb or acid) hits the bomb, it explodes and the items <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the left and the  right will be destroyed  ! Very
useful for removing a wall and other barriers  ! <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a fish, you can move it to the left or to the right
and it falls down  (if it can!).<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moves will be done - step by step. After pressing '<b>
