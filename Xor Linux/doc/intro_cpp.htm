Xor ? Congratulations !<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will be expected to you ? Each maze is a 32 x
32  field, but you can only see an 8 x 8 part of it !<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15 levels will wait for you, level 1 is very simple
- to make you hungry for more !<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each level you will master will increase your fame
and  your competence in solving future challenges<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - and there are lots of it ! &nbsp;But now, take a
look  at the inhabitants of Xor: <br>

 the four parts to have a complete map. <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collect one piece,  and you can see a fourth  part
of  the maze - by pressing the 'M' key. <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collect all four and you can  see all !<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a chicken. You can push it up or down,
if  there's  enough space !  <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it always wants to chase from right to the left,
 if there's  no wall  or other item that <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could prevent it from chasing !<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a bomb. If a chicken or a fish (or a falling
   bomb or acid) hits the bomb, it explodes and the items <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the left and the  right will be destroyed  ! Very
 useful for removing a wall and other barriers  ! <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a fish, you can move it to the left or to the

 bomb or acid)  hits  the acid bottle, it crashes and the items <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the top and the bottom  will be destroyed - because
 acid is corrosive ! Very useful for removing walls <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and other barriers !  Like a chicken, you can move
